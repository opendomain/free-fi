{"name":"Free-Fi.Org","tagline":"Free SECURE open Wi-Fi","body":"### :warning: NEVER use open unsecured Wi-Fi. **EVER.**\r\n[Identity theft](https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/investigate/cyber/identity_theft) is one of the fastest growing crimes.  If you use a wireless network Wi-Fi that does not use a password, [your private information can be stolen by anyone](http://dilbert.com/strip/2015-06-21).\r\n\r\n### :signal_strength: Use **\"Free-Fi\"** as the default password\r\nMost WiFi modern networks today can offer WPA2 security, which means that even if the password is public, then other people can not access your data. (Note: A dedicated hacker MAY be able to steal your session on initial connection, but this is still safer than NO password).\r\n\r\nIf you go to a hotel or coffee shop that has an open and unsecured WiFi, then please ask them to set a password.  The suggested default password for all wireless networks should be **\"Free-Fi\"**. This means the wireless network is participating in \"Free-Fi\" and users should abide by the [TERMS](http://Free-Fi.Org/terms.html) of use.\r\n\r\n### :closed_lock_with_key: Free-Fi patent \r\nI filed for a provisional patent that would allow anyone to automatically connect to any open wireless networks SECURELY. I am giving up all rights to this idea and making this PUBLIC so no one can patent this in the future to ensure everyone can have FREE secure open networks.\r\nThe simplified version of the protocol is this:\r\n* Connect to an an OPEN Network (named **Free-Fi**).  \r\n * All requests on this Wi-Fi will redirect to a resource (web page or text file) with the password for another secure network.\r\n* Use this password to connect onto the other SECURE network\r\n* Profit!\r\n\r\nThe DRAFT patent filing can be found here [http://Free-Fi.org/patent.html](http://Free-Fi.org/patent.html) \r\nAfter going through the patent design, I realized that we can make ALL wireless networks secure by using a slightly modified version of TLS.\r\n\r\n### :person_with_blond_hair: About Ric Johnson\r\n* :trophy: Winner 2015 [INTRAPRENEUR innovation](http://leadership-labs.org/) award \r\n* :tv: Inventor of the world's first DVR - [Free.TV](http://bit.ly/freeTVpitch)\r\n* :rocket: Founder of [NoSQL.Com](http://bit.ly/NoSQLPitchDeck) - the API to BigData\r\n* :heart: Founder of [OpenDomain](http://OpenDomain.Org) , a non-profit that give domains to Open Source groups or charities\r\n * [Ecmascript](http://www.ecmascript.org/)\r\n * [OpenAjax](http://www.openajax.org/OpenDomain.php)\r\n * [XMPP (Jabber)](http://xmpp.org/xsf/press/2005-12-30.shtml)\r\n * [Drupal](http://www.opendomain.org/success-stories/drupal-press-release/) :droplet:\r\n * [FOSDEM](https://archive.fosdem.org/2008/sponsors.html)\r\n * [OSCon](http://www.oscon.com)\r\n * [Google Schema](https://schema.org/docs/faq.html#17)\r\n * [W3C - WebPlatform](http://www.webplatform.com/)\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/jsON\" class=\"twitter-follow-button\" data-show-count=\"false\" data-size=\"large\">Follow @jsON</a>\r\n<script>!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],p=/^http:/.test(d.location)?'http':'https';if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=p+'://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js';fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document, 'script', 'twitter-wjs');</script>","google":"UA-70102025-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
